This' an implementation of the Magic Square problem using C pointers that I did in my free time.

=> Test values are hard coded in the main() method & the test result is displayed on the console.
By default, a magic square of size 3 is displayed. This size can be changed in the main() method.

=> Rudimentary tests have been successfully performed.
Tested on Visual Studio 2019.
